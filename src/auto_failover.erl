%% @doc Does auto failover nodes that are down.
%% It works like that: You specify a certain time interval (age) a node
%% must be down, before it will be auto-failovered. There's also a
%% maximum number of nodes that may be auto-failovered. Whenever a node
%% gets auto-failovered a counter is increased by one. Once the counter
%% has reached the maximum number of nodes that may be auto-failovered
%% the user will only get a notification that there was a node that would
%% have been auto-failovered if the maximum wouldn't have been reached.
